# BEP-DSM-IronParticle

This code has been developed for the BEP project 'Reduced-order discrete source model for iron particles' by Lemar Abdi. 
The functions used for the properties of the particle are developed by Xiaocheng Mi. 
The file 'Gasmodel.m' corresponds to the results obtained in the BEP report and the implementation of the gas model, the implementation of the particle model corresponds to the 'ParticleModel.m' file.
